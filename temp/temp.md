* What has life looked like for you this week?

It's been a rollercoaster! It was fine until we got that roofing estimate, which sent me into a depressive mood, exacerbated by Mom being Mom. Father's Day was mostly fine, although because of the stuff earlier in the week it was hard to maintain positivity into the afternoon and in the evening I was very much just done. Yesterday was Pete Day and I finished the last step in my big networking project which feels good. I was in the garage that was at least 90F all day up and down a ladder so I'm feeling pretty sore and tired today, but it was a good boost. Helped along by the home inspector that swung by to give us his opinion on the roof. He thinks it'll be good to go for awhile after the repairs that the roofer suggested. We're getting another estimate early next week and then we'll make a decision.

* What was your biggest challenge?

Holding it together on father's day. Emily and the kids did cute things and the girls were completely fine and happy all day but because of the aforementioned stuff and the whole every father figure in my live is gone thing it was hard.

* What made you most proud of yourself this week?

Finishing my big project. It's the kind of thing that's never actually done but this is a good point to put a pin in it and say that everything that follows is new projects.

Also being able to calm myself down and talk Lily through a meltdown after I yelled at her for something that in retrospect was silly. Abby touched some paint that she shouldn't have and then Lily wanted to do the same thing even after I told her no twice and moved the paint away from her, so then I yelled and she melted into a puddle and ran off.

* Were there any connections made between our work so far and how things have gone this past week?

We talked about observing my reactions to various things and noting time of day, etc. Me getting cranky in the evening is a pretty well established pattern, and I think that held this week pretty consistently. Other things 

* How would you like to spend our time together this session? What are you least feeling like talking about?
